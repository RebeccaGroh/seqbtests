Description: This package implements different Bayesian tests to compare the 
    performance of Machine Learning Algorithms. The performance of the 
    algorithms to be compared can be built up within the packages by a function 
    written by the user and can be directly compared within the tests. For this 
    purpose, the sequential Bayesian tests are provided, in which the number of 
    generated performance values does not have to be fixed at the beginning. 
    Instead, after each replication it is checked whether there is a 95% 
    probability to determine which algorithm performs better. If this threshold 
    is reached, the build-up of replications is stopped early, which can result 
    in significant time savings. These tests work either on a single or multiple
    data sets. Further, some standard Hypothesis tests are provided.
