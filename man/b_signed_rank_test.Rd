\title{Bayesian Signed Rank test}
\usage{
b_signed_rank_test(df, problemset = NULL, baseline, compare = NULL,
  algorithm = NULL, measure = NULL, s = 0.5, z_0 = 0,
  weights = NULL, mc_samples = 1e+05, rope = c(-0.01, 0.01))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Input data frame.}

\item{problemset}{Problem set on which the test should be performed.}

\item{baseline}{First algorithm.}

\item{algorithm}{Second algorithm. If not defined, every algorithm will be 
tested against baseline.}

\item{measure}{Measure column.}

\item{s}{Prior pseudo-observation probability.}

\item{z_0}{Prior pseudo-observation.}

\item{weights}{A-priori weights.}

\item{mc_samples}{Number of samples of the distribution.}

\item{rope}{Region of practical equivalence.}
}
\description{
This function implements the Bayesian version of the signed rank test. 
    The performance of one baseline algorithm on one or multiple data sets is 
    compared to either one or multiple algorithms.
}
\details{
The test has first been implemented in rNPBST. For testing over multiple 
    datasets, donÂ´t specify the problem set argument in the function. Note 
    that if no measure column is defined per default the first column 
    defined as measure_* in the data frame is used.
