\usage{
b_signed_rank_test(df, problem = NULL, baseline, compare = NULL,
  algorithm = NULL, measure = NULL, prob = 0.95, s = 0.5,
  z_0 = 0, weights = NULL, mc_samples = 1e+05, rope = c(-0.01,
  0.01))
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Input data frame.}

\item{problem}{Problem set on which the test should be performed.}

\item{baseline}{First algorithm.}

\item{algorithm}{Second algorithm. If not defined, every algorithm will be 
tested against baseline.}

\item{measure}{Measure column.}

\item{prob}{Probability, which the decision that the Baseline is better than 
the algorithm is based on. The default is 0.95.}

\item{s}{Prior pseudo-observation probability.}

\item{z_0}{Prior pseudo-observation.}

\item{weights}{A-priori weights.}

\item{mc_samples}{Number of samples of the distribution.}

\item{rope}{Region of practical equivalence.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
    \item{code{measure}} A string with the name of the measure column used.
    \item{code{method}} A string with the name of the method used.
    \item{code{baseline}} A string with the name of the baseline algorithm.
    \item{code{posteriror_probabilities}} A data frame with one row for every 
        algorithm that is compared to the baseline. The columns show the 
        posterior probabilities and whether significance appears.
}
}
\description{
This function implements the Bayesian version of the signed rank test. 
    The performance of one baseline algorithm on one or multiple data sets is 
    compared to either one or multiple algorithms.
}
\details{
The test has first been implemented in rNPBST. For testing over multiple 
    datasets, donÂ´t specify the problem set argument in the function. Note 
    that if no measure column is defined per default the first column 
    defined as measure_* in the data frame is used.
