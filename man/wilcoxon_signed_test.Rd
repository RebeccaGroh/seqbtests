\title{Wilcoxon signed-rank test}
\usage{
wilcoxon_signed_test(df, problem, baseline, algorithm = NULL,
  measure = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Input data frame.}

\item{problem}{Problem set on which the test should be performed.}

\item{baseline}{First algorithm.}

\item{algorithm}{Second algorithm.}

\item{measure}{Measure column.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components: 
\itemize{
    \item{code{measure}} A string with the name of the measure column used.
    \item{code{method}} A string with the name of the method used.
    \item{code{statistic}} The value of the statistic used in the test.
    \item{code{p_value}} The p-value for the test.
}
}
\description{
This function implements the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A 
    non-parametric statistical hypothesis test to compare the means of two 
    paired samples.
}
\details{
The test has first been implemented in scmamp. 
    Note that if no measure column is defined per default the first column 
    defined as measure_* in the data frame is used.
