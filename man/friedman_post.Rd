\title{Friedman's post hoc test}
\usage{
friedman_post(df, measure = NULL, control = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Input data frame.}

\item{measure}{Measure column.}

\item{control}{The name of the control algorithm. If this parameter is not 
provided, all algorithms are compared against each other.}
}
\value{
A matrix with all the pair wise raw p-values.
}
\description{
This function implements a Friedman post hoc test. It computes 
the raw p-values for the post hoc based on Friedman's test.
}
\details{
The test has first been implemented in scmamp. Note that the default
value for measure is the first measure column in the data frame.
